392. Is Subsequence

Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

You may assume that there is only lower case English letters in both s and t. t is potentially a very long (length ~= 500,000) string, and s is a short string (<=100).

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Example 1:
s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"

Return true.

Example 2:
s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"

        :type t: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if s=='':
            return True
        index=0
        for c in t:
            if index==len(s):
                return True
            if c==s[index]:
                index+=1
        return index==len(s)
