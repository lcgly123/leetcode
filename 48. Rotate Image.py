48. Rotate Image

You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

Example 1:

Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]


class Solution:
    def rotate(self, matrix):
        """
        :type matrix: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: void Do not return anything, modify matrix in-place instead.
        """
        # NB 啊，矩阵旋转90度可以这么写，先倒序，再转置
        matrix[::] = zip(*matrix[::-1])
